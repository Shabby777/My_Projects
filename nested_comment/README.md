# Nested Comment Section

This project is a simple interactive nested comment section, built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add comments, reply to existing comments, and delete comments and replies (with the exception of the initial comment). Each comment and reply is displayed in a visually structured, nested format, emulating a common social media comment thread.

## Features

- **Add New Comments**: Users can add top-level comments.
- **Reply to Comments**: Each comment has a "Reply" option, allowing users to create nested replies.
- **Delete Comments and Replies**: Comments and replies can be deleted, except for the initial comment.
- **Character Limit and Counter**: Comments and replies have a 250-character limit, with a live character counter displayed as the user types.
- **Toggle Reply Form**: The reply form can be toggled to hide or show, improving visual clarity.
- **Toggle Nested Replies**: Nested replies can be collapsed or expanded to manage the view of longer threads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structure and content of the comment section.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity, including adding, replying to, and deleting comments and replies.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, providing a responsive and clean layout.
